# SQL examples 

These SQL examples have been to introduce some basic SQL commands and concepts. Covered functions include SELECT, INSERT, CREATE, ALTER, UPDATE, DELETE. The code has been written with MySQL as target. Nonetheless it should basically run on any SQL-capable database as no special commands have been used.

## Words of precaution
**&tldr; Think before you run something. And creating backups is never wrong**

* Running any of the code from this repo/collection of code is the sole responsibility of you as the user
* Examples are just that: examples
* If you do not understand it, do not run it. Especially not on production environments
* Code might behave differently on your platform/in your environment than intended
